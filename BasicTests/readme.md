Basic tests for the Kori-ULB model
Some tests require input files that are provided for the Antarctic ice sheet on 25km resolution, the Amundsen Sea Embayment (Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier) at a resolution of 3 km, and the Aletsch Glacier (Switzerland) at 150 m resolution.
All other tests have a synthetic setup and the scripts generate the input data.
